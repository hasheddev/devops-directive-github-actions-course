Motivation

Cronjobs + Shell scrits on random server
Due to speed of software updates (days/day) the tooling for automating and building test has evoled to make shipping fast and safe. CI and automated came into the picture from 1997 instead of manual testing.
This was tinderbox that looks at commits and builds for target and reports back for bugfix later.Since there has been multiple integration tools like gitlab ci/cd/ githubactions, jenkins e.t.c

Common Workflow Types:
1 Validate: Lint, Test, Static analysis(security, code quality).

2 Build: Executable, Conainer Image

3 Deploy: Push based deploys, Update tags for git-ops deploys

4 Repo Automations: Release automations, Stablw Issues/Prs, Dependency upgrades

Why Github Actions
Most popular are Jenkins, Githubactions, Gitlab Ci and Azure Devops server
- Code is already on github already(likely)
- Minimal barrier to entry
- Expansive public marketplace
- Market Leadership leads to improved tooling

Why No
- If not using gitub already
- Less powerful pipeline reuse primitives
- Painful debugging experience
- Limited analytics/obeservability

Concepts and Terminology
Any event generally like pushing and otheres from github api cal be accesed in github Actions
Workflows(pipelines) - file contains jobs that may have multiple steps and are triggered by events
Runner: Server environment that executes jobs. vary across jobs
